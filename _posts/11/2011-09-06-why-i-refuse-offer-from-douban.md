Douban.com is undoubtedly a great website, which is why I apply for one Python position there. My interview was successful. But there are some details I think people from douban did not handle well.

The company locates in one old factory, at least seen from inside, it is. Environment is open but a little disorder, especially there are people sitting along the aisle. I cannot feel work enthusiasm there.

The process of interview is a little annoying. I went there around 2pm and stayed there for almost 5 hours. Only one people asked me for drink. I spent a lot of time in waiting for the next interviewer ( I think this is not a big problem since I came for a job ).

The biggest problem is from HR. Maybe she is just showing her normal attitude, but what I feel is haughty. Maybe I am wrong, but I would like to say what I feel. As one HR, she should be kind and think of a way to attract one candidate to work in her company.

The offer is great, I have to say. But I do not like 14-month salary. 2 extra months salary means you need to work there the whole year. For me, it is a constrain. I am not sure if this is allowed, but I know many of my friends work in companies like douban. This policy is an invisible rope.

The most unhappy thing was when I said maybe I would be abroad again and not work for a whole year, HR told me I should tell her earlier then they do not spend time checking my case. WTF! Money is an important factor when I consider the offer, but I prefer freedom more. I would undertake the punishment after I sign on the contract, but you ask me too much.

I believe I am in the black list of douban now ;p They will not hire me next time. Though I did not tell all the truth when I talk with HR, I still like to go outside again. Maybe one year, maybe two years, I will try my best.
