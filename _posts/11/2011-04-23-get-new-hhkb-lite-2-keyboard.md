I am so happy that I get HHKB Lite 2 today. First, thanks to my friend MePine and WenJin who help me get this keyboard in China and bring it to Sweden.

Let's see what it looks like.

Yeah, Control is next to A. It is awesome.

After several minutes practice, I find I always forget where Delete is (it is next to ]). And Space is a little too noisy. Besides, I think I should forget Caps lock, because to use Caps lock, I need to type Fn + Tab at the same time.

In all, I like this keyboard, because of its great key layout and 60% size.
