Last week is such a boring week. I could not focus my mind on my work. For one thing, maybe it has been 2 weeks since I started to work. I started to get tired. For another, I still cannot forget two years in Sweden. Life in Beijing is totally different from Sweden. Sometimes I thought, what IÂ  am going to do if I do not have relatives. I had asked myself this question several times these years. It seems there is nothing I cares a lot.

Well, what I want now is to work in a small company, just keep working without disturbing.
