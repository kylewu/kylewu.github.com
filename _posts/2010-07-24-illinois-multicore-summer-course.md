The course of multicore is one week long (5 days actually).

Here is some key word during the course:

* shared memory
* OpenMP
* PThreads
* TBB (intel)
* VS2010
* Vectorization
* GPU
* java parallelism

Both TBB and VS2010 are very good tools to develop multicore programme. There are many websites about these topics.
