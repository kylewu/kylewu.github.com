Beer is the world's most widely consumed alcoholic beverage; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea.[[wiki:beer]]

In a word, I like beer as I always say in front of new friends. For coder, there is even a conception called 'Beerware' [[wiki:beerware]]. Beer makes me feel comfortable and focus on one thing.

See the photo above? Quite cool, is it? It is the beer glass from Github. I bought a set of it and really enjoy it when I code.

Drink a beer and let's code.
