![Pancake Day]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/4362449294_fd9ea1423d_s.jpg) There was a international friendly football match yesterday, that was China vs Portugal. Obviously, the result is pretty easy to guess. However, I, as a chinese football fan, would like to watch this game.

For some reason, CCTV didn't broadcast. I searched in google, and found a great website.

In the first several minutes, the speed was very very good. Suddenly, it stopped.

You see, I should click the advertisement to continue watching the game. Great idea, ha?

I think this is not a bad idea. For one thing, when the advertisement appears, people need some time to response. It's helpful for those slow internet connection to buffer. For another, advertisement gives tv provider great profit to support this great work.
