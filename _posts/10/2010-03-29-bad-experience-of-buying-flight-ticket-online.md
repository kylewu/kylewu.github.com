I searched in several websites to find cheap flight ticket. Finally, I booked ticket in Seat24.se. It's easy to finish all the steps. I told my mother immediately.

However, I got a call from Seat24.se the day after I booked (that's today). She said the price increased 600kr. What? I have already paid, and now, you wanted more? I refused to pay another 600kr.

Now, my ticket is gone. And my money has not returned back. I hope I can receive it tomorrow, maybe.

PS. I get my money back today, 1th April, 3 days after I received that call.
