The course of multicore is one week long (5 days actually).
Here is some key word during the course:
shared memory
OpenMP
PThreads
TBB (intel)
VS2010
Vectorization
GPU
java parallelism

Both TBB and VS2010 are very good tools to develop multicore programme. There are many websites about these topics.
