In a word, I like beer as I always say in front of new friends. For coder,
there is even a conception called 'Beerware' [[wiki:beerware]]. Beer makes me feel
comfortable and focus on one thing.

See the photo above? Quite cool, is it? It is the beer glass from Github. I
bought a set of it and really enjoy it when I code.

Drink a beer and let's code.
