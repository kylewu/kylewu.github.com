I am gonna start to work for [gaia] next month. It is so exciting.

	Gaia is the user interface for b2g,
	and it is a Web application that runs locally on a B2G device, emulator, desktop build, or Firefox build.

There are lots knowledge I need to learn, such as [b2g] and jQueryMobile. And I
plan to write something about [gaia] after I start to work.
