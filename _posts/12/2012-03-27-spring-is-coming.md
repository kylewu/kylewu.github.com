Finally, spring is coming.

It was a tough winter. Many things happend in this half a year. Unwill to think
them. Since spring is coming, I need to make a plan from now on.

Apparently, my plan is secret and I do not want anyone sees it. But, I have one.

SO, CHEER UP WENBIN. And this blog is revived.
